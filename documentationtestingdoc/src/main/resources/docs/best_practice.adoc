= Best practices

== Naming

Thinks as documentation and chapters, not as test.

* Do not use `Test` but chapter name
DefineATitle and not DefineTitleTest

* Same for methods

== Chapter content

Try to show what is the output, not only what you want as output.

Do it as if you don't know what output is.

That means you have to display what the output return when it's what you expect as well as when it's not what you expect.
This is a real difference with classical tests where there is only one path.
