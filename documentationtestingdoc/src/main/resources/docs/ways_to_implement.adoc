= Ways to implement

We just need to check that there is no difference in documents generated.
There is several ways to do that.


Global process is decomposed in 3 steps.

[cols="1,1"]
|====
| Module | Need

| Generate documentation | source code, *.adoc writer
| Check there is no difference | file comparator, *.adoc
| Generate Html from asciiddoc files | asciidoc, *.adoc
|====

Generate documentation not required any framework.
The only need is writing files containing what we need to check.
There is no constraint about language used to generate files.
Using xUnit simplify this but it's not required.
We can create one file by test using method name and run it with tools already provided in IDE.

== Identify modified files

=== Git version

Git is made to check modification between files on disk and files in repository.
So, we just have to generated files and ask to git if there is a difference with his version.

We can call `git status` to see files that has changed.
To provide a simple output, a script `checkDocInFolder.sh` verify all differences compare to staged files in git.

The advantage is that it check all files in doc folder: missing files (because a test was removed), images and main documentation that include all others.

We also can add a verification after each test to verify the test from IDE.
It's done in Java with JUnit 5 in methods annotated `@AfterEach` using JGit for example.

When you want to approve a file, you just have to staged it.

Using git involves to staged approved files.

=== Approvals version

Approvals is a library to make golden master (https://github.com/approvals).
Using it, each test produce a `.received` file.
It is compared with a `.approved` file with the same name.
The test fail if there is a difference.

The method is simple, produce files easy to compare and is integrated to the test lifecycle.
Inconvenient is that the library is specific to a language and need to be available for it.
There is also some difficulties to well identify tests that were deleted or renamed.
It's also could be difficult to check other files generated like images.
