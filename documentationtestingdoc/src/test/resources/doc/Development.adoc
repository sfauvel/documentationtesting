== Generate a full documentation

[WARNING]
====
This chapter is deprecated. It must to be rewrite.
====

To generate a single file with all tests, launch `MainDocumentation` class.

`convertAdoc.sh` takes the single generated file to convert it to HTML.

You can use `RunAll` class to make all process in a single command.
launch tests, generate an asciidoc with all files generated and convert it to HTML.

== On Windows

Scripts are written to run with bash.
On windows, you can execute them in a Git bash console for example.

It's not possible to run docker with volume in a bash script on Windows.
To execute projets on specific language, compiler need to be installed in machin.

We also used docker to convert asciidoc to html.
On windows, this generation could not be done when executing all project.
A script _convertADocToHtml.bat_ is provided to generate Html for one project.

== Modify doc format

If you decide to change style of the documentation generated, all your tests will be failed.
You can approve them renaming all files `*.received.adoc` to `*.approved.adoc`.
