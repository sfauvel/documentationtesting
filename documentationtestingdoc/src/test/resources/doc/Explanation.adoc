== Principal

//L'idée est d'avoir une documentation générée à partir du code afin qu'elle reflète le comportement actuel de l'application.
The idea is to have documentation generated from the code so that it reflects the current behavior of the application.

//On peut alors valider, après relecture, que ce qui est écrit correspond aux attentes du produit.
We can then validate, after proofreading, that what is written corresponds to the expectations of the product.

//Ces documents deviennent la référence sur laquelle on s'appuira pour détecter des régressions.
// Tout changement sera considéré comme un test en échec.
These documents become the reference on which we will rely to detect regressions.
Any change will be considered a failed test.

== Another way to test

With this approach, we have to change the way we test software.
We need to think more about documentation than about tests.
We just have to make visible how the software behave whatever this behavior.
Secondly, we will decide if this behavior is the one we expect.

== What is a test

A test is the verification that a behaviour is the one we expect.
To do that, we need two things.
First, we need to have all information to describe the behavior in a specific scenario.
Generally, it means to know the context, steps achieved and results obtained.
Second, we have to check that it is what we expect.

The automation is the capacity to reproduce all of that without human needs.

== Compare with other approches

* TDD: We can use it to do TDD. At the end, our test are not only technical code but they provides a documentation.
* BDD: It's very close to BDD expect that the documentation is not the instructions to execute a test. This gives more possibilities to write a readable documentation.
* Golden Master: It's a golden master but reference files are not just data. We can understand each case and validate them more easily when functional change.
* Living documentation: It's a living documentation that have to be validate once so we'll be warned when behavior change.
