= Tutorial

== Quick start

You can experiment it simply with almost nothing.

. Use your usual test framework.
. Create a test that write to a text file.
. Put the result of the test execution in that text.
. Add the file to git.

You now have a non regression test in place.
Each time you run this test, a change in the file is a regression.
You can use git to detect file changes and to see the differences with the previous version.

By the time, you can add useful information to the output file and format it to be more readable.


== Java project

link:{github-pages}/documentationtesting[DocumentationTesting] is a java library which provides tools to easily implement this approach.

=== Ready to test project

You can use the link:https://github.com/sfauvel/TryDocAsTest[TryDocAsTest] project.
It's a preconfigure project to start with a complete tool.

=== Use it in your own project

You want to create your own Java project to try this approach.
The only module you need is `documentationtestesting` one.

Start by writing a test that inherits from `org.sfvl.doctesting.junitinheritance.ApprovalsBase`.

Use `write` method to write all you want to be in documentation.
It should be at least input and output.
When you write output, you don't write values expected but only values given by the application.

Then run test as usual.
First time, test fails and a file is produced in `src/test/docs` with the name of the test.
The filename ends with `received.adoc`.

Read the file and verify that it looks like as you want.
If it is the case, rename it with `approved.adoc` instead of `received.adoc`.

Relaunch tests and they should pass.
