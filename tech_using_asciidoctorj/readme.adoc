= Generate html with asciidoctorj

https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctorj/[asciidoctorj] is a library that convert asciidoctor files to html.

We can use it instead of installing Asciidoctor or use a docker image to produce HTML.

`Asciidoctorj` is easy to use on a java project but it's less portable than using docker to project with other languages.
