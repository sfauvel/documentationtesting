:rootpath: .

Imagine that your tests are as readable as documentation and that they look like this

====

.2+^.^| *15 - 30*

or like that

This is what this project offers you to set up.

== Principal

Instead of writing tests, we just writing documentation from the code.

Each test method is a documentation generator that not indicate expected result but just write the result.

The user has to verify documentation produced and to validate that it describe the expected behavior.
When documentation changed, test fails and the user needs to validate or not this new behavior.

It's a mix between link:https://www.amazon.com/Living-Documentation-Cyrille-Martraire/dp/0134689321[living documentation]
and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test[Golden Master] (or link:https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/characterization-testing[characterization-testing]]).

Full project documentation is here: https://sfauvel.github.io/documentationtesting/

=== Git version

Here, we just generated files and compare them with git version. +
It's done in `@AfterEach` to check when we throw one test from IDE.

A script `check.sh` verify all differences compare to the head git version (you can do the same using only git).
The advantage is that it check also missing files (because a test was removed) and main documentation that include all others.
Every files within doc folder will be checked.

When you want to approve a file, you just have to commit it.

Process is decomposed in 3 steps.


[cols="1,1"]
|====
| Module | Need

| Generate doc | source code, *.adoc writer
| Check there is no difference | shell, git, *.adoc
| Generate Html from adoc | asciidoc, *.adoc
|====

Generate documentation not required any framework.
The only need is writing files containing what we need to check.
There is no constraint about language used to generate files.
Using xUnit simplify this by creating one file by test using method name and run it with tools provided.


== Examples

Several examples are provided to show how we can use it and what it can produce.

ifdef::fulldoc[]
include::./documentationtestingdoc/target/adoc/demo_list.adoc[]
endif::[]

== What does it change

The advantage is that we not have to check the expected result in tests.
If the result we see in documentation is right, that's ok.
The second advantage is that we focus on documentation so that all our tests are readable by every one.

This idea comes from writing some code that is only configuration.
In that case, writing tests is just rewriting code and there is no real value.
But, this information still needs to be checked.

== Quick start

The only module you need is `documentationtestesting` one.

Start by writing a test that inherits from `org.sfvl.doctesting.ApprovalsBase`.

Use `write` method to write all you want to be in documentation.
It should be at least input and output.
When you write output, you don't write values expected but only values given by the application.

Then run test as usual.
First time, test fails and a file is produced in `src/test/docs` with the name of the test.
The filename ends with `received.adoc`.

Read the file and verify that it says what we expected.
If it is the case, rename it with `approved.adoc` instead of `received.adoc`.


.Example with DemoTest.java
[source, java]
----
include::demo_basic/src/test/java/org/sfvl/demo/DemoTest.java[]
----

|===
| File generated to validate
a| include::{rootpath}/demo_basic/src/test/docs/org/sfvl/demo/DemoTest.should_be_5_when_adding_2_and_3.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
|===

== Project

To get source and examples: https://github.com/sfauvel/documentationtesting

=== Generate a full documentation

To generate a single file with all tests, launch `MainDocumentation` class.

`convertAdoc.sh` takes the single generated file to convert it to HTML.

You can use `RunAll` class to make all process in a single command.
launch tests, generate an asciidoc with all files generated and convert it to HTML.

If you decide to change style of the documentation generated, all your tests will be failed.
You can approve them all using `approveAll.sh`.

=== Plugins

A plugin for IntelliJ is provided in approvalsDocPlugin folder.

include::approvalsDocPlugin/README.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
