== Performances

We compare performance of tests using different approaches.

Using Git, we can verify documentation on each test or not.
When we run all tests, this verification is done at the end by script that launch tests.
To have total time using Git without verification on each test, we should add time of global checking.
This step is fast, it's just a shell script with some git commands.
