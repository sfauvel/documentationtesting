= Hide title


// Test result for MyTestWithoutTitleOnOneTest: Success
You can hide a test title adding the NoTitle annotation to the test.
It's usefull to reuse content of a test in different place without keeping the original structure.
You also want to separate the content of one chapter through different test but display them under only title.

.Test example using hiding title

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MyTestWithoutTitleOnOneTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    static final ApprovalsExtension doc = new SimpleApprovalsExtension();

    @Test
    public void intro() {
        doc.write("First line");
    }

    @Test
    @NoTitle
    public void my_method() {
        doc.write("My content without title");
    }

    @Test
    public void conclusion() {
        doc.write("Last line");
    }
}

The file generated from the method with `NoTitle` annotation has no header.
On the final rendering, it's like it was part of the previous chapter.
