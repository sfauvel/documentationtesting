= Creating a test using ApprovalsExtension


// Test result for MyTest: Success
This is an example to create a simple test using `ApprovalsExtension`.

You have to write a class and add `RegisterExtension` annotation on an attribute.
This extension will check that content of `DocWriter` has not changed since the last time.
`DocWriter` passed to the `ApprovalsExtension` is used to indicated what we want to write to the output.

.Test example using `ApprovalsExtension`
[source, java, indent=0]
----
class MyTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    static final ApprovalsExtension doc = new SimpleApprovalsExtension();

    @Test
    public void test_A() {
        doc.write("In my *test*");
    }

}
----

When executing test method `test_A`, a file `_MyTest.test_A.approved.adoc` is generated and contains the following text
----
include::../../samples/_MyTest.test_A.approved.adoc[]
----
Filename and title come from method name.
The chapter content contains what was written using `DocWriter`
