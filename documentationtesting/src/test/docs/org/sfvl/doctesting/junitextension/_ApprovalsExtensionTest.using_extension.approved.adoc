= Creating a test using ApprovalsExtension


// Test result for MyTest: Success
This is an example to create a simple test using `ApprovalsExtension`.

You have to write a class and add register an `ApprovalsExtension` attribute using .`RegisterExtension` annotation.
This extension will check that everything wrote using `doc.write` method has not changed since the last execution.

.Test example using `ApprovalsExtension`
[source,java,indent=0]
----
class MyTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    static final ApprovalsExtension doc = new SimpleApprovalsExtension();

    @Test
    public void test_A() {
        doc.write("In my *test*");
    }

}
----

When executing test method `test_A`, a file `_MyTest.test_A.received.adoc` is generated and contains the following text
----
include::../../samples/_MyTest.test_A.approved.adoc[]
----
If this file is identical to the `_MyTest.test_A.approved.adoc`, then the test is a success and `_MyTest.test_A.received.adoc` is removed.
Otherwise, test fails and we can compare those two files to see what has changed.

File name and title come from method name.
The chapter content contains what was written using `doc.write`.
