= Creating a test using ApprovalsExtension


// Test result for OneTest: Success
This is an example to create a simple test using `ApprovalsExtension`.

You have to write a class and add register an `ApprovalsExtension` attribute using `RegisterExtension` annotation.
This extension will check that everything wrote using `write` method has not changed since the last execution.

.Test example using `ApprovalsExtension`
[source,java,indent=0]
----
package org.sfvl.samples.justone;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.RegisterExtension;
import org.sfvl.doctesting.junitextension.ApprovalsExtension;
import org.sfvl.doctesting.junitextension.SimpleApprovalsExtension;
public class OneTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    static final ApprovalsExtension doc = new SimpleApprovalsExtension();

    @Test
    public void test_A() {
        doc.write("In my *test*");
    }

}
----

When executing test method `test_A`, the following text is generated.
----
include::../../samples/justone/_OneTest.test_A.approved.adoc[]
----
If this content is identical to the `_OneTest.test_A.approved.adoc`, then the test is a success.
Otherwise, test fails and the generated text is written to the `_OneTest.test_A.received.adoc` file.
So we can compare those two files to see what has changed.

File name and title come from method name.
The chapter content contains what was written using `write`.

Files are stored in `src/test/docs/org/sfvl/samples/justone` directory which contains:

* _OneTest.approved.adoc
* _OneTest.test_A.approved.adoc

There is one file per test and one file for the class.
