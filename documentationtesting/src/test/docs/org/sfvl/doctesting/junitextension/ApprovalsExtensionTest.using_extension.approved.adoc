= Using extension

This is an example of `ApprovalsExtension` usage.

You have to write a class and add `RegisterExtension` annotation on an attribute.
This extension will check that content of `DocWriter` has not changed since the last time.
`DocWriter` passed to the `ApprovalsExtension` is used to indicated what we want to write to the output.
