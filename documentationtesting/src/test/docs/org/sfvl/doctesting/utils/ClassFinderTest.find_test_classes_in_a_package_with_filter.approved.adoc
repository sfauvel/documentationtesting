= Find test classes in a package with filter

By default, all classes containing a test method are found.
It's possible to exclude some test methods because they are not relevant in the context.
If all test methods of a class are excluded, then the class will not be return as a found class.

Here, we exclude all method in a class with name starting by 'Second'.
