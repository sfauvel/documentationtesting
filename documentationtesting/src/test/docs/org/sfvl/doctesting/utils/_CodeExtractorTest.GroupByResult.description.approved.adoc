It's sometime interesting to group all values that provides the same result.
It can be used to show several ways of doing the same thing.
We can simply display result once with all cases that can be used to build it.
You also can just check that we obtain the same result with different values.
In that case, there is only one key in the result
and you can just say that all values are the same.
