`FindLambdaMethodTest` class provides tools to extract information from a method reference.
It retrieves the method associated with the method reference, so it's possible to get name.
This allows to use the method reference instead of writing the method name as a string.
Using refactoring tools, names are automatically updated and there is no risk to misspelled a name.
