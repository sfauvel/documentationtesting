[#org_sfvl_doctesting_utils_DocPathTest_make_path_independent_of_operating_system]
= Make path independent of operating system

Path in asciidoc files must used '/' independently of operating system and file separator.

It's important to always generate the same reference file (.adoc) because we compare it with the last generated one.
Otherwise, the test could fail when executed on another operating system.
