= Document path

One of the essential points to create a documentation, is links between files.
It's even more important with documentation as test.
For a java method, there is the java file, the approved and received files, and the html file.
We need to easily create paths to those files.
We also need to reference one file from another one either to include it or to make a link to another page.

This class helps to navigate between all that files.
