= Available paths from DocPath

`DocPath` contains the information defining the location of the item to be documented.
It's not a real path but just the location in the tree of documents.
From this class, we can generate the real paths to the different kinds of associated documents.

We can create a `DocPath` the code below (where `MyTest` is declared in package `org.sfvl.samples`).

        final DocPath docPath = new DocPath(clazz);
