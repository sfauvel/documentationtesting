== check_class_for_structure

We need to specify a class when defining document structure.
It allows to call methods on that object in lambda.
Lambda will be called with the builder instance so this class must be a super class of the builder.
There is no verification at compile time, but an exception is thrown when build is called if a wrong type was given.
