= Extract from code

We try to extract the most things from the code.
In consequence, when refering to a class or a method, 
we don't write directly it's name in the text but we use the java class or the method reference.
 We ensure that we can't have a name that not exist in the code.

.Extraction of class name and method name

            final String className = Development.class.getSimpleName();
            final String methodName = MethodReference.getName(Development::introduction);
            String text = String .format("The method `%s` is a method of the class `%s`", methodName, className);
