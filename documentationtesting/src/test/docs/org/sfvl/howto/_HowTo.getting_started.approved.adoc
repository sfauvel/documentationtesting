= Getting started

To get started quickly, you can download link:https://github.com/sfauvel/TryDocAsTest[Try doc as test] project.
It's a minimal project that is ready to use and that implements a small demo.

You can alo follow steps of the link:{ROOT_PATH}/org/sfvl/howto/Tutorial.html[Get started] page.

You can use it on your own project alongside your existing tests.
Both can work together without modifying your tests.

To do that, you need to:

* link:{ROOT_PATH}/org/sfvl/howto/InstallingLibrary.html[Installing DocumentationTesting] maven library and add dependency to your `pom.xml`

* Create a test and register ApprovalsExtension extension adding the code below to the test class.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RegisterExtension
static ApprovalsExtension extension = new SimpleApprovalsExtension();
----

* Write in your test everything you want to see in your documentation using `doc.write("...")`
You don't have to write assertions, tests will be passed when generated documents are the same as the last time.
