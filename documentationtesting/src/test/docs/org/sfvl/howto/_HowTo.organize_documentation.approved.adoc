= Organize documentation

To organize documentation, we have to consider test methods as the generator of one chapter.
Each test will have a title by default following by text added executing it.
Some of them show a specific behavior like any classic test.

But, it's also possible to have one test that runs several cases and presents a global report of the execution.
Even if there is a regression for one case in that test, 
all results will be written in the document and can be compared with the reference file.

We also can create a test method that just write text without code execution.
It can be used to add general description or to minimize what it is written in a test to simplify its reuse.

The final document respect the order of the method in the test file.
We can use subclasses to create subchapter in the document (see: link:{ROOT_PATH}/org/sfvl/doctesting/junitextension/ApprovalsExtensionTest.html#org_sfvl_doctesting_junitextension_approvalsextensiontest_nested_class[Nested class])

It's not necessary to follow source code organization in tests.
Instead, organize your test packages according to the document you want to generate.
