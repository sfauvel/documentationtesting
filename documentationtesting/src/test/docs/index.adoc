This project is composed of two main packages.

* link:org/sfvl/doctesting/DocTestingDocumentation.html[org.sfvl.doctesting]
: Tools to make test validating generated files.
* link:org/sfvl/docformatter/FormatterDocumentation.html[org.sfvl.docformatter]
: Utilities to format documentation.

Section link:org/sfvl/howto/HowTo.html[How to]
 shows how to do some common needs.

== Getting started
