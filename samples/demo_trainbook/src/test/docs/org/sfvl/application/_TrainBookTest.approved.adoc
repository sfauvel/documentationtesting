[#org_sfvl_application_trainbooktest]
= Book train ticket

Train tickets can be booked in advance, though we do reserve some
capacity in each coach for people who have tickets but didn't
reserve a seat.

[#org_sfvl_application_trainbooktest_max_70_percent]
== Max 70% of entire train can be booked

This allows people who show up just before the train leaves
to get a seat.
