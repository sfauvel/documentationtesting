= Minimal demo to generate a documentation used as non regression test

== Generate an asciidoc file

We want an *output document* that looks like:

---

include::_DemoTest.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

---

You can do it with *a simple link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoc] file* like this one:

----
include::_DemoTest.adoc[]
----

To generate this kind of file, that is just a text file, you can do it with this simple code below.
To check there is no regression, put your file under source control and verify that it was not modified between two executions.
[source, java]
----
include::../java/org/sfvl/demo/DemoTest.java[tag=test, indent=0]
----


== Check regression with Approvals

If you want to automate that the file has not changed from the last approved file,
*you can use Approvals* with the following code.
First time, test failed because there is no approved file.
Once you approved the file, the test passes until the output changes.

[source, java]
----
include::../java/org/sfvl/demo/DemoWithApprovalsTest.java[tag=test, indent=0]
----


== Use DocumentationTesting

You can also *use DocumentationTesting tool* that integrate Approvals
, format file name, add comment description and add some commodities.

[source, java]
----
include::../java/org/sfvl/demo/DemoWithDocumentationTestingTest.java[tag=test, indent=0]
----

The final file look likes:

---

include::org/sfvl/demo/_DemoWithDocumentationTestingTest.approved.adoc[leveloffset=+2]]

---
