= Demo test

Demo of a property base testing generating a documentation.

We generate a list of objects with some random values.
We group objects by the invariant, the value to check or by the result of a property.
When there is only one value, we can display it and approved the document (like in chapter below).
When there is more than one value, we write them so the test fail, and we have all information to investigate.
